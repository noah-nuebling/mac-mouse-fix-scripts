# mac-mouse-fix-scripts

Collection of Python scripts which we want to share between the mac-mouse-fix and mac-mouse-fix-website repos.

The reason for creating this is that we want to share the localization logic between mac-mouse-fix and mac-mouse-fix-website (but perhaps, this will come in handy for other things later.

We plan to embed this repo as a 'subtree' in both the mac-mouse-fix and mac-mouse-fix-website repos.
