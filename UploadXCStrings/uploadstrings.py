Mac Mouse Fix can now be translated into different languages! üåç 

And you can help! üß†

## How to Contribute

To contribute translations to Mac Mouse Fix, follow these steps:

1. **Download Translation Files**
    <details> 
      <summary><ins>Download</ins> the translation files for the language you want to translate Mac Mouse Fix into.</summary>
    <br>

{download_table}

    *If your language is missing from this list, please let me know in a comment below.*
    
    </details>
    
    <!--
    
    #### Further Infooo
    
    The download will contain two files: "Mac Mouse Fix.xcloc" and "Mac Mouse Fix Website.xcloc". Edit these files to translate Mac Mouse Fix.
    
    -->
    
2. **Download Xcode**
    
    [Download](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835?l=en-GB&mt=12) Xcode to be able to edit the translation files.
    <!--
    > [!NOTE] 
    > **Do I need to know programming?**
    > No. Xcode is Apples Software for professional Software Development. But don't worry, it has a nice user interface for editing translation files, and you don't have to know anything about programming or software development.
    --> 
    
3. **Edit the translation files files using Xcode**
    
    The Translation Files you downloaded have the file extension `.xcloc`. 
    
    Open these files in Xcode and then fill in your translations until the 'State' of every Translation shows a green checkmark.

    <br><br>
    
    <details> 
      <summary><ins>Click here</ins> for a more <b>detailed explanation</b> about how to edit your .xcloc files in Xcode.</summary>
    
    1. **Open your Translation Files**
    
        After downloading Xcode, double click one of the .xcloc files you downloaded to begin editing it.
    
        <img width="607" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-27 at 09 24 39" src="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/assets/40808343/a70addcf-466f-4a92-8096-eee717ecc9fe">
    
    2. **Navigate the UI**
    
        After opeing your .xcloc file, browse different sections in the **Navigator** on the left, then translate the text in the **Editor** on the right.
    
        <img width="1283" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-27 at 09 25 44" src="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/assets/40808343/62eb0db2-02a0-46dd-bc59-37ad892915ee">
    
    3. **Find translations that need work**
    
        Click the 'State' column on the very right to sort the translatable text by its 'State'. Text with a Green Checkmark as it's state is probably ok, Text with other state may need to be reviewd or filled in.
    
        <img width="1341" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-27 at 09 30 10" src="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/assets/40808343/daea7f0d-d823-4c75-9f06-5a81c56f836e">
    
    4. **Edit Translations**
        
        Click a cell in the middle column to edit the translation.
    
        After you edit a translation, the 'State' will turn into a green checkmark, signalling that that you have reviewed and approved the translation.
        
        <img width="1103" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-27 at 10 47 04" src="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/assets/40808343/56b1f109-6319-4ba8-991d-8fced7b35f9b">
    
    
    </details>
    
4. **Submit your translations!**
    
    Once all your translations have a green checkmark, you can send the Translation files back to me and I will add them to Mac Mouse Fix!
    
    To send your Translation Files:
    - **Option 1**: Add a comment below this post. When creating the comment, drag-and-drop your translation files into the comment text field to send them along with your comment.
    - **Option 2**: Send me an email and add the translation files as an attachment.

## Credits

If your translations are accepted into the project you will receive a mention in the next Update Notes and your name will be added as a Localizer in the Acknowledgments!
