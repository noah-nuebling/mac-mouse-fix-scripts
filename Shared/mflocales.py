    This is sooo convoluted. But I guess I'm having fun. 
    
    Update: Gave up on this
    
    The point of this is to only make the strings inside Markdown.xcstrings 'visible' to Xcode while exporting.
        The only way I know to prevent Xcode from deleting the content of Markdown.xcstrigns is by 
        1. setting the strings' extractionState to manual 
        2. Not having the file be part of any build target 
            (aka not having the file 'visible' to Xcode. 'visible' is not the best term but that's what we mean)
        
        Simply setting the extractionState to manual would be a very simple and totally sufficient solution. We could still temporarily set it back to extracted_with_value while we sync the .xcstrings file. 
        If we do that, the only disadvantage that I can think of is that Xcode wouldn't disable editing the English version of the string in the .xcstrings editing GUI. (A GUI which normally only I can see) 
        -> This is really not important at all!
        However, this very slight problem (and me being pretty nerdy) prompted me to implement this function to make the Markdown.xcstrings file temporarily 'visible' to Xcode, by editing the .pbxproject file.
        This way, we can keep the file 'invisible' to Xcode normally, so that it doesn't attempt to delete its content, but then make the file 'visible' during exports, so that Xcode can properly extract the .xcloc files for us.
        
        -> This is totally unnecessary and quite hacky and brittle. We should just set the extractionState to manual inside Markdown.xcstrings. (But I don't want to)
        
        Update: If we do this, Xcode will STILL delete all the strings from Markdown.xcstrings as it's exporting .xcloc files. So we'd have to set the extractionState of every string to manual before exporting - on top of this 'visibility' stuff. 
                It's getting too annoying. I'll just keep the state as 'manual' and keep the files visible to Xcode, and the temporarily set it to extracted_with_value as we're syncing the strings.

        value: 
            The user-facing string in the development language (english). The goal is to translate this string into differnt languages.
        comment: 
            A comment providing context for translators.
        full_match: 
            The entire substring of the .md file that we extracted the key, value, and comment from. Replace all full_matches with translated strings to localize the .md file.
    
    The localizable strings inside the .md file can be specified in 2 ways: Using the `inline syntax` or the `block syntax`.
    
    The `inline sytax` follows the pattern:
    
        {{value||key||comment}}
        
        Examples:

            bla blah {{ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgements||acknowledgements.title||This is the title for the acknowledgements document!}}
            
            blubb
            
            bli blubb {{ðŸ˜” Roasting of Enemies||roast.title||This is the title for the roasting of enemies document!}} blah
    
    The `block syntax` follows the pattern:

        ```
        key: <key>
        ```
        <value>
        ```
        comment: <comment>
        ```
        
        Example:
        
            ```
            key: acknowledgements.body
            ```

            ```
            comment: This is the intro for the acknowledgements document
            ```
            

    Keep in mind!
    
        For the `block_syntax`, any free lines directly above or below the <value> will be ignored and removed. 
        
        So it doesn't make any difference whether the markdown source looks like this:

            ```
            key: <key>
            ```
            abcefghijklmnop
            qrstuvwxyz
            ```
            comment: <comment>
            ```
        
        Or like this:
            
            ```
            key: <key>
            ```
            
            
            
            abcefghijklmnop
            qrstuvwxyz
            
            
            
            ```
            comment: <comment>
            ```
        
        -> I tried to respect the free lines around the <value>, but I couldn't ge the regex to work like that. But honestly, it's probably better this way. 
            Since, this way, translators will never have to add blank lines above or below their content to make the layout of the .md file work as intended.
            
    Notes:
    - Use https://regex101.com to design and test regexes like the ones used here.
    - To test, you might want to post the whole .md file on regex101. That way you can see any under or overmatching which might not be obvious when testing a smaller example string.
